Perfect! We can create a **Week-by-Week Micro-Roadmap in Markdown** for the **entire 5-Year Strategic Roadmap**, broken into actionable weekly tasks.

I’ll structure it so that:

* **Year 1** → Deep Technical Foundation
* **Year 2–3** → Principal-level Technical Authority + Startup Readiness
* **Year 4–5** → Entrepreneurial Execution + Executive Leadership Readiness

We’ll include:

* **Task**
* **Cue** (trigger)
* **Craving / Motivation**
* **Response / Action**
* **Reward**
* ✅ Checkboxes for progress tracking

It will be fully Markdown-ready so you can use it in **Notion, Obsidian, or any Markdown viewer**.
